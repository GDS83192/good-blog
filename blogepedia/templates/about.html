						<p>Hello geeks, This is my first web -app which I have developed using flask and deployed it on Heroku.
							 This is a blogging app where the users can create their account and post their blogs on any topic 
							 their choice.There are many features which will be added in the coming time like the password resetting 
							 option, searching the blogs on the basis of various category onto which the blog was written and search 
							 feature which is present on the home page is disabled and it will be funcitoning soon once we have a 
							 minimum number of posts here. We will be alos adding 
							the trending and liking and commenting option as well as a upvote option. <br> So stay connected. <br> Happy Blogging.....</p>
